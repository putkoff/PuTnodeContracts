# PuTnodesMath.sol

## Overview

`PuTnodesMath.sol` is a smart contract developed for the Ethereum blockchain, using Solidity version 0.8.13. This contract is designed to provide a library of safe mathematical operations, specifically tailored for use in financial and cryptographic computations where precision and security are paramount.

## Features

- **SafeMath Library**: A collection of mathematical functions that protect against overflow and underflow errors. Includes `tryAdd`, `trySub`, `tryMul`, `tryDiv`, and `tryMod`.
- **Context and Ownable Contracts**: These contracts provide basic access control mechanisms, where there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.
- **NeFiLib Library**: A custom library with additional utility functions for address lists and mathematical operations.
- **Address Library**: Offers functions related to Ethereum addresses, including checking if an address is a contract and safely sending Ether.
- **IERC20, ERC20, and Related Contracts**: Implements the standard interface for Ethereum tokens (ERC20), including functions for token transfers, allowances, and balance queries.
- **Drop Management**: Interfaces and abstract contracts for managing drops (airdrops).
- **Fee Management**: Interfaces and abstract contracts for managing transaction fees within the contract ecosystem.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Solidity 0.8.13 or later for compiling.
- An Ethereum wallet with Ether for deploying and interacting with the contract.

### Deployment

1. **Compile the Contract**: Use a Solidity compiler to compile `PuTnodesMath.sol`.
2. **Deploy on Ethereum Network**: Use a platform like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat to deploy the contract to Ethereum Mainnet or a test network.

### Interaction

Interact with the contract using Ethereum transaction calls. Functions available for interaction depend on the role and permissions of the interacting account (e.g., owner, user).

### Functions

- SafeMath operations can be used to perform arithmetic operations safely.
- Ownable functions to transfer ownership, renounce ownership, etc.
- ERC20 standard functions for token interactions.
- NeFiLib, Address, and other utility functions as per your project requirements.

## Security

This contract uses SafeMath to prevent overflow and underflow errors, a common security concern in smart contracts. Regular audits and testing are recommended to ensure contract security, especially in a financial context.
